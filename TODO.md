# On my mind

* Documentation
* Use Kotlin Json

# Where to take it

* Plaxolotl - cli scripts are just an interface to a portable execution format. This format has all the metadata defined explicitly. For example: content type,
  variable replacement yes/no, etc.
* Auto-generate Instacli based on OpenAPI metadata. Use AI to make sense of stuff?
* Run Release templates

# Command-line support

* Parse command line properly
* Kotlin native? => Use Pure Kotlin libraries
* Go?

# Instacli as glue

* Shell and pipe support
* Database support (SQLite or something)
* Write file / Read file
* Web server support

# Instacli language

* Combine `If` and `When`and introduce `else`
* Raw and live / Apply variables
