# On my mind

## MCP

* Make MCP server like HTTP server. (Consistent use of script, file, output, starting stoppping, port numbers etc)
* Make MCP server composable in Yaml with 'Mcp tool' command.
* TODOs in MCP server.
* Process MCP result as list

## AI agents

* https://github.com/JetBrains/koog
* Move `Script info: input` to top level of script for better AI processing. Names:
    * `Input` -- nice and clean name but it is not literally input, it is more like a schema
    * `Input schema`
    * `Input parameters`
    * `Input variables`
    * `Script input`

## In general

* AI to generate scripts: notebook type interaction to write scripts
* Document Json Patch (uses RFC 6902)

# Actually build something

* Home Recipes
    * Store stuff on file system with a construct like Connect to
    * Store stuff on sqlite using same construct
    * Edit lists

# Installable artifact

* Produce a clean, lightweight, native library
* Node / TypeScript?
* Compile to WASM
* Kotlin native? => Use Pure Kotlin libraries
* Go?

# Easyspec

* Extract into a separate module:
    * Markdown doc
    * Cli tests
    * Schema stuff
    * Http server
    * ...what's left not to extract?
* Naming
    * Easyspec.ai
    * Easyspec
    * Quickspec
    * Spec.it
* Add tests for samples
    * Test script for a directory, using multiple commands

# Instacli language

## Core

* Clean up Exceptions and error handling
* Proper "StackTrace"
* Define commands in Instacli
* Secrets
* Properly handle: null, empty, boolean, int
* Convert to yaml
* Stream and pipe output as Yaml array of lines
* Find a way to confirm default input parameters vs. just taking them for granted. Interactive mode would trigger
  confirmation?

## Types

* Document types
* Define array and string types in type system
* Define 'output type' on Script info
* Turn types into JSON schema
* Refactor types and directory info
* Base on TypeScript types

## Docs

* Document literate programming style with cli scripts in markdown
* Run CLI command as 'semi-interactive': print mock output and exit.

## Http

* Configuring connections out of the box with packaged instacli scripts
* Clean up Connect to: be smart about multiple connections and tokens. Currently `connect-to` script in Digital.ai only
  checks if something has been set as Http defaults
* Built-in OAuth. It's kinda cool that you can do it in Instacli but not that you should... Makes the script 'turn into
  code'.

## Shell & Files

* Support stdin:
  if (System.`in`.available() != 0) { val input = Yaml.mapper.readTree(System.`in`)}
* Code organization
    * Versioning and auto-upgrading of commands
    * Review Script info on directories
    * Support modules
* Shell: option to capture output as yaml.

## Improve slow startup

* Jackson is slow on Kotlin: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/69
* Jackson Jr?
* Alternative Yaml lib: https://github.com/pwall567/kjson-yaml
* Or rewrite as Go or TypeScript

# Bugs

* BUG: First line of output is not captured if shell script asks for user input => command appears to hang
* BUG: Create connection doesn't work

```shell
hes@Mac samples % cli digitalai/release/login 
Login to Digital.ai Release

* Available commands: connect                     Logs in to Digital.ai Release

Instacli scripting error

Unknown command: Create Release connection

In login:

  If:
    empty: "${endpoint}"
    then:
      Create Release connection: true
      As: "${endpoint}"

```

* BUG: in select connection

```shell
Login to Digital.ai Release

* Available commands: select-release-connection   Select the default connection
? Select account to log in with * Create new account
Please configure a connection to Digital.ai Release

Instacli scripting error

Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.TextNode cannot be cast to class com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode (com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.TextNode and com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode are in unnamed module of loader 'app')

In create-release-connection.cli:

  If:
    empty: "${account.url}"
    then:
      Create release connection: ""
      As: "${account}"

```

# Where to take it

* Plaxolotl - cli scripts are just an interface to a portable execution format. This format has all the metadata defined
  explicitly. For example: content type, variable replacement yes/no, etc.
* HouseApp
* Run Release templates
* Instacli as glue
    * Shell and pipe support
    * https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html
    * Database support (SQLite or something)

* Coding is the Unhappy Path
    * 80% of code is about exceptions to the rule
    * 80% of coding goes into the happy path
    * Typical scenario
        1. Struggle to get the happy path working
        2. Don't apply learnings to code base
        3. Over 50% (or more) of the code is about the exceptions
        4. Exception handling / alternative paths are implemented on top of a shaky code base as an afterthought
    * Why not try "Exception Driven Programming". But: you can't _start_ with the exceptions.
    * Define the happy path as declarative as possible. Build the exception flow around it?
    * Mold the language to have fewer exceptions: be declarative, idempotent
