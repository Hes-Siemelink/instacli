# Core concepts in Instacli

## Language

These topics define the basic infrastructure of Instacli scripts.

* [Instacli Yaml Scripts](Instacli%20Yaml%20Scripts.spec.md)
* [Instacli Markdown Documents](Instacli%20Markdown%20Documents.spec.md)
* [Variables](Variables.spec.md)
* [Eval syntax](Eval%20syntax.spec.md)
* [Organizing Instacli files in directories](Organizing%20Instacli%20files%20in%20directories.spec.md)

## Core library

To create a useful Instacli script, you will need some practical commands that actually do something.

* [Command reference](../commands) contains the overview and documentation of the built-in commands.

## Documentation

Instacli is ideally developed by writing the documentation and tests first. You can embed Instacli snippets
in [Markdown documents](Instacli%20Markdown%20Documents.spec.md) and define the unit tests as part of the spec.
