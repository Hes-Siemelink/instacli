# Core concepts in Instacli

## Language

These topics define the basic infrastructure of Instacli scripts.

* [Anatomy of an Instacli file](Anatomy%20of%20an%20Instacli%20file.md)
* [Organizing Instacli files in directories](Organizing%20Instacli%20files%20in%20directories.md)
* [Variables](Variables.md)
* [Eval syntax](Eval%20syntax.md)

## Core library

To create a useful Instacli script, you will need some practical commands that actually do something.

* [Command reference](../commands) contains the overview and documentation of the built-in commands.

## Documentation

Instacli is ideally developed by writing the documentation and tests first. You can embed Instacli snippets in Markdown
documents and define the unit tests as part of the spec.

* [Writing Instacli documentation](Writing%20Instacli%20documentation.md) walks you through the way Markdown files are
  written.
