# Instacli Spec

Instacli is defined here.

* [Language](language/README.md) defines the structure of the Instacli scripting language
* [Command reference](commands/README.md) defines all commands with descriptions, code examples and tests.
* [CLI](cli/README.md) defines the `cli` shell command

The Kotlin implementation in **[src](/src)** produces a working shell command and runs all code examples and tests to
validate it.

<!--
## Fun things to do with Instacli

1. Run the [cli](cli/README.md) command
2. Write Instacli scripts in Yaml or Markdown
3. Extend Instacli
    * Write the specification of new commands or behavior in Markdown, including code examples and tests
    * Write the implementation in the Kotlin reference implementation.
4. Write an implementation of Instacli in a new language. Or better, let AI do it for you. Just follow the spec!
