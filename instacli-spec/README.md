# Instacli Spec

Instacli is defined here.

* [CLI](cli/README.md) defines the `cli` shell command
* [Core concepts](core-concepts/README.md) defines the structure of the Instacli scripting language
* [Command reference](reference/README.md) defines all commands with descriptions, code examples and tests.

The Kotlin implementation in **[src](/src)** produces a working shell command and runs all code examples and tests to
validate it.
