# Instacli Spec

Instacli is defined here.

* [CLI](cli) defines the `cli` shell command
* [Core concepts](instacli-spec/core-concepts) defines the structure of the Instacli scripting language
* [Command reference](instacli-spec/reference/README.md) defines all commands with descriptions, code examples and
  tests.

The implementation in **[src]/src]** produces a working shell command and runs all code examples and tests to validate
it.
