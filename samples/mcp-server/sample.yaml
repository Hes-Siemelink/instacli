      * WHAT...Dangerous rip currents expected.

      best swimmers away from shore into deeper water.
    instruction: |-
      If you enter the surf zone, always have a flotation device with
      you and swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax
      and float, and do not swim against the current. If able, swim in
      a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face
      the shore and yell or wave for help.
    response: Avoid
