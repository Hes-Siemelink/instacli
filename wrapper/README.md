# Instacli Wrapper

This directory contains a wrapper script for Instacli so you don't need to build it.

## Running Instacli

Run Instacli by invoking the wrapper script:

    ./cli

The wrapper script will download the published version of Instacli specified
in [.instacli/wrapper.conf](.instacli/wrapper.conf) and run it.

## Copy the wrapper

You can use the wrapper script in your Instacli project by copying the following files:

    .instacli/wrapper.conf
    cli

## Instacli versions

For the latest versions, check the [Instacli Releases](https://github.com/Hes-Siemelink/instacli/releases) page on
GitHub.
